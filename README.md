CFIT is a tool to perform a template fit with including
systematic uncertainties in a correlation matrix. Systematic
correlations between templates and bin-by-bin correlations in the fit
variables are taken into account. The tool also allows one to estimate
statistical and systematic uncertainties on the fit parameters and to
perform the measurement of the scale factors.
